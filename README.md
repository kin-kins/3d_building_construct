Components used are-
* Stepper Motor
* A4889 stepper motor driver
* Arduino Mega
* Dc Motor
* L293D motor shield
* Stpper motor belt
* Gripper
* 3d frame
* 3d block aur Lego Bricks



Construction is based on 3d Printer design. It has 3 stepper motor (2 for the base movement and 1 for the Vertical left or Vertical Right).The frame is made of allimunium and it is designed to be very light. The moving components are kept lubricated and desinged to provide very less friction.

It has gripper to hold and drop a brick. A gear system the increases and decreases the height. Controlled stepper mototor makes the whole thing work.
